<h2 id="Opening-a-command-line-'terminal'">Opening a command line 'terminal'<a class="anchor-link" href="#Opening-a-command-line-'terminal'"> </a></h2><p>Installation of ASPECT, as well as setting up and running ASPECT models on Durham's Linux cluster Hamilton is typically done via the command line on a text terminal. Since we can only access Hamilton remotely, we will need to set up this terminal facility remotely too. The way to do this will depend on the computer operating system you are using.</p>

<p>There are generally 2 ways to use your local machine:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For Windows and Mac computers, the software package <a href="https://wiki.x2go.org">X2Go</a> can be used to log into the University's linux system <code>mira</code>. Using <code>X2Go</code>, you will create a 'window into Hamilton' to type in commands for Hamilton, and to view results from postprocessing software that runs remotely on Hamilton.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Or you use a simple <em>terminal</em> to run calculations on Hamilton, and then download results from Hamilton to your local machine to do the postprocessing steps. This is straightforward and doesn't require any software installation on Linux or Mac operating systems. For Windows, it still requires some some software installation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both options are described in more detail below.</p>
<h2 id="1.-Creating-a-window-into-a-remote-linux-machine-from-a-Windows-or-Mac-machine-using-X2Go">1. Creating a window into a remote linux machine from a Windows or Mac machine using X2Go<a class="anchor-link" href="#1.-Creating-a-window-into-a-remote-linux-machine-from-a-Windows-or-Mac-machine-using-X2Go"> </a></h2><p>To use Hamilton from a Windows or Mac machine, we can use the software package <a href="https://wiki.x2go.org">X2Go</a>. This will use the option 1, described above, i.e. all calculations and postprocessing are run on Hamilton, and your Windows machine will provide a 'window into Hamilton'.</p>
<h3 id="X2Go-installation">X2Go installation<a class="anchor-link" href="#X2Go-installation"> </a></h3><h4 id="download-and-install-the-X2Go-software-(updated-on-20181006):">download and install the X2Go software (updated on 20181006):<a class="anchor-link" href="#download-and-install-the-X2Go-software-(updated-on-20181006):"> </a></h4><ul>
<li>Open a web browser and go to <a href="https://wiki.x2go.org">https://wiki.x2go.org</a></li>
<li>In the column on the left, under 'Download', click 'Getting X2Go'</li>
<li>On a Windows computer: <ul>
<li>Under the header 'X2Go Client', there is a box, in which you can click on 'mswin' in the Download option. This will start downloading a setup wizard called 'X2GoClient_latest_mswin32_setup.exe'</li>
<li>Run the wizard, and answer a few installation questions: choosing the default option/setting is probably fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On a Mac: <ul>
<li>Under the header 'X2Go Client', there is a box, in which you can click on two different DMG files in the Download option: one for OS X 10.11 and 10.12, and one for macOS 10.13 and higher. Choose the one that matches your Mac operating system, and download the file.</li>
<li>Double-click the downloaded file, which opens an install Window. Drag the X2Go icon into the Applications folder. </li>
<li>To allow installation and running the software, you may hae to allow installation of software that doesn't come from the App store (like this one): Open Apple (top-left) -&gt; System Preferences, then choose 'Security and Privacy'. In the 'General' tab, under 'Allow apps downloaded from:', the X2Go software should be listed, and you should be able to click a button to allow installation.</li>
<li>Now you should be able to choose the X2Go software from your Applications 'launchpad', and run it. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Configuring-X2Go">Configuring X2Go<a class="anchor-link" href="#Configuring-X2Go"> </a></h4><ul>
<li>From the Windows Start button (bottom-left), run the newly installed 'X2Go Client'</li>
<li>You'll probably see a blue&amp;grey 'X2Go Client' window being opened, and probably also a 'Session preferences - New session' window. If the latter doesn't open automatically, click 'Session' -&gt; 'New session ...'</li>
<li>In the 'Session preferences - New session' window, enter the following info:<ul>
<li>Under 'Host', enter <code>mira.dur.ac.uk</code></li>
<li>Under 'Login:', enter your CIS username</li>
<li>Under 'Session type', choose 'MATE'</li>
<li>click 'OK' at the bottom of the window. Now a light-grey box should appear in the darker-grey area on the right of the 'X2Go Client' window. Your X2Go client is now set up and ready for usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-X2Go">Using X2Go<a class="anchor-link" href="#Using-X2Go"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>If not already open, start X2Go: from the Windows Start button (bottom-left), click 'X2Go Client', which will open the blue &amp; grey window.</li>
<li>Click the light-grey 'New session' in the dark-grey area on the left and press enter. It should now ask you for your CIS password.</li>
<li>When running the session for the first time, it will probably warn you that the 'Host key verification failed', and asks 'Do you trust the host key?'. This is normal, and you can sefely click 'Yes'.</li>
<li>It should now go through the connection procedure, and a new Window will open called 'New Session'. This is essentially your terminal on the 'mira' server, which should look very similar to the one you would get when logging onto a linux machine on one of the computers on the campus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2.-Logging-onto-Hamilton-using-a-simple-terminal">2. Logging onto Hamilton using a simple terminal<a class="anchor-link" href="#2.-Logging-onto-Hamilton-using-a-simple-terminal"> </a></h2><p>If we are logging into Hamilton to install ASPECT, or to set up and run models, but do all postprocessing and visualisation on your local machine, then a simple terminal is sufficient to set up. Depending on the operating system of your local machine, this can be one in the following way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux OS: If you are using a Linux operating system, you are probably already familiar with command line terminals. If you use one of the computer room computers on the campus that has the option to boot with a linux OS, then you can open a terminal window by clicking on the black 'terminal' screen in top task bar, but if you are using your own linux machine with a different linux flavour, opening a terminal might be done differently.  </li>
<li>With Mac OS, click the 'Launchpad' (black rocket symbol), then 'Other', then 'Terminal'</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the terminal set up, you can directly log into Hamilton:</p>

<p>(where <code>^username^</code> should be replaced with your CIS username), and provide your CIS password. (Note that the <code>-X</code> option will allow the remote machine (i.e. Hamilton) to open windows on your local machine. This option typically works on Linux systems, but on Linux systems, it requires installation of extra software.</p>

<ul>
<li>MS Windows does not run a linux operating system, so creating a remote login is the only option. However, an alternative to <code>X2Go</code> described above the software is to use a simple software tool <a href="https://www.putty.org/"><code>putty</code></a> to log into Hamilton. This tool is only text-based, and cannot be used to run software from Hamilton that requires a window (e.g. Paraview). But it does allow you to set up and run models with ASPECT. Simply download an executable and put it in your local desktop folder. To transfer data from Hamilton to your local machine (or the other way around), <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a> is a easy to use software tool. </li>
